a. Current policy text
-----------------

2.0 Assignment Criteria

In order to help decrease global routing complexity, a new AS Number should be
used only if a new external routing policy is required, see RFC1930.

A network must be multihomed in order to qualify for an AS Number.

When requesting an AS Number the routing policy of the Autonomous System must
be provided. The new unique routing policy should be defined in RPSL language,
as used in the RIPE Database.

The RIPE NCC will assign the AS Number directly to the End User upon a request
properly submitted to the RIPE NCC either directly or through a sponsoring
LIR. AS Number assignments are subject to the policies described in the RIPE
NCC document entitled “Contractual Requirements for Provider Independent
Resource Holders in the RIPE NCC Service Region”.

b. Proposed policy text

2.0 Assignment Criteria

A new AS number should only be assigned when there is technical requirement
which cannot be reasonably satisfied with private AS number.

When requesting an AS Number the routing policy of the Autonomous System must
be provided. The new unique routing policy should be defined in RPSL language,
as used in the RIPE Database.

The RIPE NCC will assign the AS Number directly to the End User upon a request
properly submitted to the RIPE NCC either directly or through a sponsoring
LIR. AS Number assignments are subject to the policies described in the RIPE
NCC document entitled “Contractual Requirements for Provider Independent
Resource Holders in the RIPE NCC Service Region”.


11. Rationale
Current policy presumes AS numbers are used in globally visible manner with
redundancy, however there are valid requirements for globally unique AS number
where one or both of these presumptions are incorrect. There are situations
where a globally unique AS number is required, but there never will be any
global visibility.
In such case your upstream may not exist or in more common case it is
yourself, which might support reducing requirement from 2 to 1, however when
upstream is yourself then such validity check is guaranteed not to fail, which
makes it redundant.

Due to AS number not carrying YRC (yearly recurring charge) we necessarily
need to implement some policy complexity creep to avoid someone requesting
2**32 AS numbers. The policy necessarily will be soft and open to
interpretation. With YRC for AS number we would be allowed to keep policy
short and hard.

The intention of the soft policy is that RIPE NCC has understanding shared by
community of what is valid use of AS number and will interpret request under
those terms.
Examples of acceptable technical reasons
  - RFC1930
  - RFC2270
  - Multihoming
  - Connecting separately maintained private networks
  - Need for global address visibility

We may also need separate 'last n 16b ASN' policy which addresses special
nature of 16b ASNs. Perhaps limiting 16b ASN 1 per organization or situation
where BGP community space is required. Perhaps also GLOP should be decoupled
from ASN to conserve IPv4 multicast addresses.

a. Arguments supporting the proposal

* In L3 MPLS VPN managed CE. You may wish to run CustomerLAN <eBGP> CE <eBGP>
  PE. PE has your regular ASN, every CE in the network can share same AS
  number via use of as-override function and Site of Origin community.
  Private AS number is not good candidate here as CustomerLAN may already use
  that
  With current policy you're forced to evaluate CE configuration in each case
  creating unnecessary complexity.

* A network might not be multihomed today, but wants to prepare all
  infrastructure so it can multi-home at a moment's notice, or have some form
  of mobility in terms of suppliers. <TODO elaborate on nothing wrong with
  single-homing with your own globally unique AS - does not hurt routing
  table slots>

b. Arguments opposing the proposal

* Policy is soft, what is acceptable 'technical requirement'? But due to lack
  of YRC in AS number we cannot have hard+simple policy.

a. Current policy text
----------------------

2.0 Assignment Criteria

In order to help decrease global routing complexity, a new AS Number
should be used only if a new external routing policy is required, see
RFC1930.

A network must be multihomed in order to qualify for an AS Number.

When requesting an AS Number the routing policy of the Autonomous System
must be provided. The new unique routing policy should be defined in
RPSL language, as used in the RIPE Database.

The RIPE NCC will assign the AS Number directly to the End User upon a
request properly submitted to the RIPE NCC either directly or through a
sponsoring LIR.  AS Number assignments are subject to the policies
described in the RIPE NCC document entitled "Contractual Requirements
for Provider Independent Resource Holders in the RIPE NCC Service
Region".

b. Proposed policy text

-----------------------
2.0 Assignment Criteria

A new AS Number is only assigned when the End User has a need that cannot be
satisfied with an existing AS Number. RIPE NCC will record, but not evaluate
this need.

The Autonomous System's routing policy should be defined with RPSL in the RIPE
RIPE Database.

The RIPE NCC will assign the AS Number directly to the End User upon a request
that is properly submitted to the RIPE NCC either directly or through a
sponsoring LIR. AS Number assignments are subject to the policies described in
the RIPE Document, “Contractual Requirements for Provider Independent Resource
Holders in the RIPE NCC Service Region”.

-----------------------

11. Rationale

The current policy assumes that an Autonomous System and its peerings are
globally visible, with the Autonomous System being multihomed with at least
two others. However, there are situations when a globally unique AS Number is
required and one or both of these presumptions are incorrect. Limited
visibility is observed in the context of GRX peering, or a more common case: a
network might be its own upstream, which supports reducing the peering
requirement from two to one.

A common practice these days (observed by the authors) is to have the AS
applicant fill in as peerings: 1) the AS Number of the actual provider, and 2)
a route collector with a globally unique ASN. The authors believe that there
is value in aligning the policy with reality, rather than continuing in the
current, less transparent way.

The authors expect that the RIPE NCC, when needed, will present an aggregated
view of AS needs for community consideration. Examples of typical needs would
be: RFC 1930, RFC 2270, multihoming, preparing to multihome (when second
provider is as-of-yet undeciced), connecting separately maintained private
networks, and private networks where the uniqueness of a private ASN cannot be
guaranteed.

12. Pro's & Con's

a. Arguments supporting the proposal

* In the context of layer-3 MPLS VPN, you may wish to run eBGP on the CE both
  in the PE's direction and the CustomerLAN's direction. The Service
  Provider's PE has your regular ASN, and every CE in the network could share
  the same AS Number via use of as-override function and Site of Origin
  community.  But a Private AS Number might not be a good candidate, as the
  CustomerLAN may already use that AS Number.  With the current policy you are
  forced to evaluate CE configuration in each case, creating unnecessary
  complexity.

* A network might not be multihomed today, but wants to prepare all
  infrastructure so it can multihome at a moment's notice, or have some form
  of mobility in terms of suppliers.

* The accuracy of the RIPE Database is more important than anything. The
  authors suspect that already today organisations deem the value of obtaining
  a globally unique ASN higher than providing truthful information regarding
  its peers to the RIPE NCC. By simply not requiring potentially falsified
  information the process's transparency is increased.

b. Arguments opposing the proposal

* An adversary could try to deplete the pool of available ASNs.

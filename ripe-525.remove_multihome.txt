a. Current policy text
-----------------

2.0 Assignment Criteria

In order to help decrease global routing complexity, a new AS Number should be
used only if a new external routing policy is required, see RFC1930.

A network must be multihomed in order to qualify for an AS Number.

When requesting an AS Number the routing policy of the Autonomous System must
be provided. The new unique routing policy should be defined in RPSL language,
as used in the RIPE Database.

The RIPE NCC will assign the AS Number directly to the End User upon a request
properly submitted to the RIPE NCC either directly or through a sponsoring
LIR. AS Number assignments are subject to the policies described in the RIPE
NCC document entitled “Contractual Requirements for Provider Independent
Resource Holders in the RIPE NCC Service Region”.

b. Proposed policy text

-----------------------
2.0 Assignment Criteria

A new AS number should only be assigned when there is technical requirement
which cannot be satisfied with an existing or private AS number.

When requesting an AS Number the routing policy of the Autonomous System must
be provided. The new unique routing policy should be defined in RPSL language,
as used in the RIPE Database.

The RIPE NCC will assign the AS Number directly to the End User upon a request
properly submitted to the RIPE NCC either directly or through a sponsoring
LIR. AS Number assignments are subject to the policies described in the RIPE
NCC document entitled “Contractual Requirements for Provider Independent
Resource Holders in the RIPE NCC Service Region”.
-----------------------

11. Rationale
Current policy presumes AS numbers are used in globally visible manner, with
the Autonomous System being multi-homed to two other Autonomous Systems.
However there are requirements for a globally unique AS number where one or
both of these presumptions are incorrect. For instnace there are situations
where a globally unique AS number is required, but there never will be any
global visibility. 

In such case the peerings may not be visible, or in a more common case: one
might be its own upstream, which supports reducing the peering requirement from
2 to 1. A common practice (observed by the authors) these days is to have the
AS applicant fill in as peerings 1) the Autonomous System number of the actual
provider, and 2) a Route Collector with a globally unique ASN.  The authors
believe there is value in aligning the policy with reality, rather than
continuing in the current, less transparent, way.

The intention of the soft policy is that RIPE NCC has understanding shared by
community of what is valid use of AS number and will interpret request under
those terms.

Examples of acceptable technical reasons:
  - RFC1930
  - RFC2270
  - Multihoming
  - Preparation to multi-home, but second provider is as of yet deciced.
  - Connecting separately maintained private networks

12. Pro's & Con's

a. Arguments supporting the proposal

* In L3 MPLS VPN managed CE. You may wish to run CustomerLAN <eBGP> CE <eBGP>
  PE. PE has your regular ASN, every CE in the network can share same AS
  number via use of as-override function and Site of Origin community.
  Private AS number is not good candidate here as CustomerLAN may already use
  that
  With current policy you're forced to evaluate CE configuration in each case
  creating unnecessary complexity.

* A network might not be multihomed today, but wants to prepare all
  infrastructure so it can multi-home at a moment's notice, or have some form
  of mobility in terms of suppliers. <TODO elaborate on nothing wrong with
  single-homing with your own globally unique AS - does not hurt routing
  table slots>

b. Arguments opposing the proposal

* Policy is soft, what is acceptable 'technical requirement'? But due to lack
  of YRC in AS number we cannot have hard+simple policy.
  
13. Authors' remarks 

We may also need separate 'last n 16b ASN' policy which addresses special
nature of 16b ASNs. Perhaps limiting 16b ASN 1 per organization or situation
where BGP community space is required. Perhaps also GLOP should be decoupled
from ASN to conserve IPv4 multicast addresses.

Because there currently is no yearly cost associated with the registration of
an ASN this policy might need some policy complexity creep to avoid a small
group of entities requesting all available AS numbers. The policy necessarily
will be soft and open to interpretation. If a yearly cost would be associated
with ASNs, the policy would likely be short and hard.

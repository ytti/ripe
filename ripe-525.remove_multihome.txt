a. Current policy text
----------------------

2.0 Assignment Criteria

In order to help decrease global routing complexity, a new AS Number
should be used only if a new external routing policy is required, see
RFC1930.

A network must be multihomed in order to qualify for an AS Number.

When requesting an AS Number the routing policy of the Autonomous System
must be provided. The new unique routing policy should be defined in
RPSL language, as used in the RIPE Database.

The RIPE NCC will assign the AS Number directly to the End User upon a
request properly submitted to the RIPE NCC either directly or through a
sponsoring LIR.  AS Number assignments are subject to the policies
described in the RIPE NCC document entitled “Contractual Requirements
for Provider Independent Resource Holders in the RIPE NCC Service
Region”.

b. Proposed policy text

-----------------------
2.0 Assignment Criteria

In order to conserve RFC1997 BGP commmunity space, a new 16 bit AS Number
should be used only if a new external routing policy is required, see RFC1930.

A network must be multihomed in order to qualify for an 16 bit AS Number.

When requesting an 16 bit AS Number the routing policy of the Autonomous
System must be provided. The new unique routing policy should be defined in
RPSL language, as used in the RIPE Database.

When requesting an 32 bit AS number routing policy or multihome requirement do
not apply.

The RIPE NCC will assign the AS Number directly to the End User upon a
request properly submitted to the RIPE NCC either directly or through a
sponsoring LIR.  AS Number assignments are subject to the policies
described in the RIPE NCC document entitled “Contractual Requirements
for Provider Independent Resource Holders in the RIPE NCC Service
Region”.

11. Rationale

The current policy assumes that Autonomous Systems, and its peerings are
globally visible, with the Autonomous System being multi-homed to at
least two other Autonomous Systems. However there are situations when
one requires a globally unique AS number where one or both of these
presumptions is incorrect.  Limited visbility is observed in the context
of GRX peering, or a more common case: one might be its own upstream,
which supports reducing the peering requirement from two to one.

A common practice (observed by the authors) these days is to have the AS
applicant fill in as peerings 1) the Autonomous System number of the
actual provider, and 2) a Route Collector with a globally unique ASN.
The authors believe there is value in aligning the policy with reality,
rather than continuing in the current, less transparent, way.

The authors expect the RIPE NCC, when needed, to be capable of applying
an understanding, shared with the community, of what valid use and need
embodies and that the NCC will interpret requests under those terms.
Examples of acceptable technical reasons would be: RFC1930, RFC2270,
Multihoming, preparation to multi-home, but second provider is as of yet
deciced, connecting separately maintained private networks.

12. Pro's & Con's

a. Arguments supporting the proposal

* In context of layer-3 MPLS VPN, you may wish to run eBGP on the CE both
  in the PE's direction and the CustomerLAN's direction. The Service
  Provider's PE has your regular ASN, and every CE in the network could
  share the same AS number via use of as-override function and Site of
  Origin community.  But a Private AS number might not be a good
  candidate as CustomerLAN may already use that AS number.  With current
  policy you are forced to evaluate CE configuration in each case
  creating unnecessary complexity.

* A network might not be multihomed today, but wants to prepare all
  infrastructure so it can multi-home at a moment's notice, or have some
  form of mobility in terms of suppliers.

* The accuracy of the RIPE Whois Database is more important than anything.
  The authors suspect that already today organisations deem the value of
  obtaining a globally unique ASN higher than providing truthful
  information regarding its peers to the RIPE NCC. By simply not
  requiring potentially falsified information the process' transparency
  is increased.

b. Arguments opposing the proposal

* What if a company starts hoarding all available AS numbers? There is
  no yearly charge associated with AS number assignments at the moment
  of writing.

* Could it be that previously aggregated prefixes are unbundled and under
  the new policy the fragments are originated by by a set of Autonomous
  System with a single, common upstream?

13. Authors' remarks

An open question is: "do we need additional text to conserve and fairly
hand out the remaining 16-bit ASNs, or do we treat all as if they are
the same like under current policy?". Perhaps limiting the number of
16-bit ASNs per organization, expecting the RIPE NCC to perform
additional review.

Because there currently is no yearly cost associated with the
registration of an ASN this policy might need some policy complexity
creep to avoid a small group of entities requesting all available AS
numbers. The policy necessarily will be soft and open to interpretation.
If a yearly cost would be associated with ASNs, the authors foresee less
complications.

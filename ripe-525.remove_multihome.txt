10. Policy Text

a. Current policy text
-----------------

2.0 Assignment Criteria

In order to help decrease global routing complexity, a new AS Number should be
used only if a new external routing policy is required, see RFC1930.

A network must be multihomed in order to qualify for an AS Number.

When requesting an AS Number the routing policy of the Autonomous System must
be provided. The new unique routing policy should be defined in RPSL language,
as used in the RIPE Database.

The RIPE NCC will assign the AS Number directly to the End User upon a request
properly submitted to the RIPE NCC either directly or through a sponsoring
LIR. AS Number assignments are subject to the policies described in the RIPE
NCC document entitled “Contractual Requirements for Provider Independent
Resource Holders in the RIPE NCC Service Region”.

b. Proposed policy text

2.0 Assignment Criteria

New AS number should only be assigned when there is technical requirement
which cannot be reasonably satisfied with private AS number.

When requesting an AS Number the routing policy of the Autonomous System must
be provided. The new unique routing policy should be defined in RPSL language,
as used in the RIPE Database.

The RIPE NCC will assign the AS Number directly to the End User upon a request
properly submitted to the RIPE NCC either directly or through a sponsoring
LIR. AS Number assignments are subject to the policies described in the RIPE
NCC document entitled “Contractual Requirements for Provider Independent
Resource Holders in the RIPE NCC Service Region”.

** FIXME ***
Basically what I want policy to communicate in RIPE friendly terms. You can
get ASN if you need to use eBGP and you cannot guarantee uniqueness of
PriveteASN ahead-of-time.
Should we have two-level requirement, one for 16b one for 32b? Or should there
be additional new policy a-like last/8 policy to help conservation of 16b
ASNs?
** FIXME **


11. Rationale
Current policy presumes AS numbers are used in globally visible manner,
however there are cases where this is untrue. There are situations where a
globally unique AS number is required, but there never will be any global
visibility.
In such case your upstream may not exist or in more common case it is
yourself, which might support reducing requirement from 2 to 1, however when
upstream is yourself then such validity check is guaranteed not to fail, which
makes it redundant.
Due to AS number not carrying YRC we necessarily need to implement some policy
complexity creep to avoid someone requesting 2**32 AS numbers. The policy
necessarily will be soft and open to interpretation. With YRC for AS number we
would be allowed to keep policy short and hard.

a. Arguments supporting the proposal

  * In L3 MPLS VPN managed CE. You may wish to run CustomerLAN <eBGP> CE <eBGP>
  PE. PE has your regular ASN, every CE in the network can share same AS
  number via use of as-override function and Site of Origin community.
  Private AS number is not good candidate here as CustomerLAN may already use
  that
  With current policy you're forced to evaluate CE configuration in each case
  creating unnecessary complexity.

* A network might not be multihomed today, but wants to prepare all
   infrastructure so it can multi-home at a moment's notice, or have some form
   of mobility in terms of suppliers. <TODO elaborate on nothing wrong with
   single-homing with your own globally unique AS - does not hurt routing
   table slots>

b. Arguments opposing the proposal

* Policy is soft, what is acceptable 'technical requirement'? But due to lack
  of YRC in AS number we cannot have hard+simple policy.
